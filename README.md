# Diabetes Insights Dashboard

A comprehensive data analytics project focused on identifying and visualizing risk factors associated with diabetes. This project combines Excel for data preparation and calculated fields with Power BI for interactive dashboards. The goal is to support healthcare analysts and decision-makers with actionable insights derived from patient health metrics.

## 📊 Project Highlights

- Predictive classification of diabetes status based on clinical indicators
- BMI categorization and blood pressure condition analysis
- Risk level segmentation to highlight high-risk individuals
- Age group comparison (Younger Adults vs Older Adults)
- Demographic breakdowns by gender and ethnicity
- Interactive dashboard for dynamic exploration

## 🧠 Objectives

- Transform raw health data into analytical features
- Identify patterns and predictors of diabetes
- Provide clear visualizations for quick decision-making
- Empower non-technical stakeholders with interpretable results

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- **Microsoft Excel** – Data preprocessing, logic modeling, feature engineering
- **Power BI** – Interactive visualizations, slicers, drill-down dashboards

## 🔍 Insights
- Obesity, elevated blood pressure, and high glucose levels are strong predictors of diabetes risk.
- Individuals categorized as Older Adults are more likely to fall into medium or high-risk groups.
- Patients with a family history of diabetes are significantly more prone to having diabetes themselves.
- Ethnicity and gender show observable variations in risk distribution, though not as prominent as health indicators.
- The dashboard enables stakeholders to instantly filter and analyze population segments based on specific risk profiles.
